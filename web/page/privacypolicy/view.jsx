              This privacy policy has been compiled to better serve those who are concerned with how their 'Personally
              Identifiable Information' (PII) is being used online. PII, as described in US privacy law and information
              security, is information that can be used on its own or with other information to identify, contact, or

              to get a clear understanding of how we collect, use, protect or otherwise handle your Personally

              <strong>Do we use "cookies"?</strong>
            </p>

            <p>
              Yes. Cookies are small files that a site or its service provider transfers to your computer's hard drive
              through your Web browser (if you allow) that enables the site's or service provider's systems to recognize
              your browser and capture and remember certain information. For instance, we use cookies to help us
              remember and process the items in your shopping cart. They are also used to help us understand your
              preferences based on previous or current site activity, which enables us to provide you with improved
              services. We also use cookies to help us compile aggregate data about site traffic and site interaction so

              <strong>California Online Privacy Protection Act</strong>
            </p>

            <p>
              CalOPPA is the first state law in the nation to require commercial websites and online services to post a
              privacy policy. The law's reach stretches well beyond California to require any person or company in the
              United States (and conceivably the world) that operates websites collecting Personally Identifiable
              Information from California consumers to post a conspicuous privacy policy on its website stating exactly
              the information being collected and those individuals or companies with whom it is being shared. - See

            <p>
              <strong>According to CalOPPA, we agree to the following:</strong>
            </p>

            <p>Users can visit our site anonymously.</p>

            <p>
              Once this privacy policy is created, we will add a link to it on our home page or as a minimum, on the
              first significant page after entering our website.
            </p>

            <p>
              Our Privacy Policy link includes the word 'Privacy' and can easily be found on the page specified above.

            </p>

            <p>
              We honor Do Not Track signals and Do Not Track, plant cookies, or use advertising when a Do Not Track
              (DNT) browser mechanism is in place.

              <strong>Does our site allow third-party behavioral tracking?</strong>
            </p>

            <p>It's also important to note that we do not allow third-party behavioral tracking</p>

            <p>
              <strong>COPPA (Children Online Privacy Protection Act)</strong>
            </p>

            <p>
              When it comes to the collection of personal information from children under the age of 13 years old, the
              Children's Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA) puts parents in control. The Federal Trade Commission,
              United States' consumer protection agency, enforces the COPPA Rule, which spells out what operators of
              websites and online services must do to protect children's privacy and safety online.
            </p>

            <p>We do not specifically market to children under the age of 13 years old.</p>

            <p>Do we let third-parties, including ad networks or plug-ins collect PII from children under 13?</p>

            <p>
              <strong>Fair Information Practices</strong>
            </p>

            <p>
              The Fair Information Practices Principles form the backbone of privacy law in the United States and the
              concepts they include have played a significant role in the development of data protection laws around the
              globe. Understanding the Fair Information Practice Principles and how they should be implemented is
              critical to comply with the various privacy laws that protect personal information.
            </p>

            <p>
              <strong>
                In order to be in line with Fair Information Practices we will take the following responsive action,
                should a data breach occur:
              </strong>
            </p>

            <p>We will notify you via email:</p>

            <ul>
              <li>Within 7 business days</li>
            </ul>

            <p>We will notify the users via in-site notification:</p>

            <ul>
              <li>Within 7 business days</li>
            </ul>

            <p>
              We also agree to the Individual Redress Principle which requires that individuals have the right to
              legally pursue enforceable rights against data collectors and processors who fail to adhere to the law.
              This principle requires not only that individuals have enforceable rights against data users, but also
              that individuals have recourse to courts or government agencies to investigate and/or prosecute
              non-compliance by data processors.

            </p>

            <p>
              The CAN-SPAM Act is a law that sets the rules for commercial email, establishes requirements for
              commercial messages, gives recipients the right to have emails stopped from being sent to them, and spells
              out tough penalties for violations.
