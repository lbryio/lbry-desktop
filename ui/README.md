## Development Setup

- Install node and npm (linux users: [use this](https://github.com/nodesource/distributions). if that doesn't work, [this gist may be useful](https://gist.github.com/isaacs/579814))
- `npm install -g yarn` (or see https://yarnpkg.com/en/docs/install)
- Run `./watch.sh` (this will `yarn install` dependencies)
